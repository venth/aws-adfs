# aws-adfs
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/aws-adfs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/aws-adfs)
[![Travis build](https://api.travis-ci.org/venth/aws-adfs.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/venth/aws-adfs.svg?branch=master)

Command line tool to easier aws cli authentication against ADFS (multi factor authentication with active directory).

Thanks to [Brandond](https://github.com/brandond) contribution - "Remove storage of credentials, in favor of storing ADFS session cookies"
aws-adfs:

> allows you to re-login to STS without
> entering credentials for an extended period of time, without having to store the user's actual credentials.
> It also lets an organization control the period in which a user can re-login to STS without entering credentials,
> by altering the ADFS session lifetime.

Thanks to [Brandond](https://github.com/brandond) contribution - "Add support for legacy aws_security_token key in credentials file"
aws-adfs supports ansible by providing two keys with security token:
* AWS_SESSION_TOKEN and
* AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN

Thanks to [Brandond](https://github.com/brandond) contribution - "Add support for Kerberos SSO on Windows via requests_negotiate_sspi"
* on windows os will be used Security Support Provider Interface

# Compatibility

As of version 0.2.0, this tool acts on the 'default' profile unless an alternate profile name has been specified on the command line or in your environment. Previous versions acted on the 'adfs' profile by default.

# MFA integration

aws-adfs integrates with:
* [duo security](https://duo.com) MFA provider

# Known issues
* duo-security
    * Error: Cannot begin authentication process. The error response: {"message": "Unknown authentication method.", "stat": "FAIL"}
    
        Please setup preferred auth method in duo-sercurity settings (settings' -> 'My Settings & Devices').
* in cases of trouble with lxml please install

  ```
  sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
  ```
* in cases of trouble with OSX Sierra (obsolete OpenSSL), upgrade OpenSSL. Example:
  ```
  brew upgrade openssl
  ```
  AND add explicit directive to .bash_profile:
  ```
  export PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH
  ```

* python 2.6 is not supported
